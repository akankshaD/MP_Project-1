Vehicle Driving Assistant
-------------------------

## Brief Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of assistance features to aid the driver (or autonomous vehicle) to drive safely. This includes a number of indicator and cues regarding the environment.  

## Dataset 
360p video of roads in and around Electronic City Phase II was recorded by us. We used a Cannon 1300D to record the video. 

## Proposed Plan of Execution:

### Phase 1 (End of March) 

* Data collection and video pre-processing

Video of roads in Electronic City was collected manually with a DSLR camera held by a pillion rider on a moving motorcycle. The video was pre-processed to reduce excessive jitter.

### Phase 2 

* Detection of potholes in images

* Pothole detection from videos 

### Phase 3

* Improving accuracy of the model

### Phase 4

* Detection of other obstacles (pedestrians, oncoming traffic etc)

## Main Challenges:

* Procuring appropriate data to work on

* Presence of noise, shadows and excessive jitter in data

* Diversity and non-uniformity among roads and potholes which makes it difficult to generalise. 

## Learning Objectives

* Finding a real world problem and formulating it as a machine perception problem

* Be able to extract appropriate features and apply machine learning algorithms to solve the problem

* Be able to read current research papers and understand the issues discussed.

* Obtaining and cleaning data
